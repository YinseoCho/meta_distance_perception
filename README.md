## Abstract

Some studies suggested that action constraints influence visual perception of distances. For instance, the greater the effort to cover a distance, the longer people perceive this distance. The present multilevel Bayesian meta-analysis supports the existence of a small action constraint effect on distance estimation (Nstudies = 37, Nparticipants = 1035). Moreover, this effect slightly varied according to the action constraint category (i.e., effort, weight, tool-use) but not according to the motor intention of the participants. Some authors argued that action constraint effects reflect an experimental demand bias rather than a genuine perceptual effect. Even if our meta-analysis did not allow to dismiss this possibility, it did not support it. To improve this meta-analysis, we encourage researchers to contribute to this meta-analysis by using our online repository to send us their published or unpublished data.
