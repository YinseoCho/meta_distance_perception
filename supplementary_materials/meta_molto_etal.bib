  abstract = {Considerable empirical evidence has shown influences of the action capabilities of the body on the perception of sizes and distances. Generally, as one׳s action capabilities increase, the perception of the relevant distance (over which the action is to be performed) decreases and vice versa. As a consequence, it has been proposed that the body׳s action capabilities act as a perceptual ruler, which is used to measure perceived sizes and distances. In this set of studies, we investigated this hypothesis by assessing the influence of arm׳s reach on the perception of distance. By providing participant with a self-representing avatar seen in a first-person perspective in virtual reality, we were able to introduce novel and completely unfamiliar alterations in the virtual arm׳s reach to evaluate their impact on perceived distance. Using both action-based and visual matching measures, we found that virtual arm׳s reach influenced perceived distance in virtual environments. Due to the participants׳ inexperience with the reach alterations, we also were able to assess the amount of experience with the new arm׳s reach required to influence perceived distance. We found that minimal experience reaching with the virtual arm can influence perceived distance. However, some reaching experience is required. Merely having a long or short virtual arm, even one that is synchronized to one׳s movements, is not enough to influence distance perception if one has no experience reaching.},

  abstract = {D. R. Proffitt and colleagues (e. g., ) have suggested that objects appear farther away if more effort is required to act upon them (e.g., by having to throw a ball). The authors attempted to replicate several findings supporting this view but found no effort-related effects in a variety of conditions differing in environment, type of effort, and intention to act. Although they did find an effect of effort on verbal reports when participants were instructed to take into account nonvisual (cognitive) factors, no effort-related effect was found under apparent- and objective-distance instruction types. The authors’ interpretation is that in the paradigms tested, effort manipulations are prone to influencing response calibration because they encourage participants to take nonperceptual connotations of distance into account while leaving perceived distance itself unaffected. This in no way rules out the possibility that effort influences perception in other contexts, but it does focus attention on the role of response calibration in any verbal distance estimation task.},

  abstract = {In a series of recent studies, Proffitt and his colleagues have reported that the perceived distance to a target is influenced by the energy expenditure associated with any action, such as walking or throwing, for spanning the distance to the target. In particular, Proffitt, Stefanucci, Banton, and Epstein (2003) reported that wearing a heavy backpack caused verbal reports of distance to increase. We conducted a study to determine whether three responses dependent on perceived distance (verbal report of distance, blind walking, and estimates of object size) are influenced by the backpack manipulation. In two experiments, one involving a between-participants design and the other involving a within-participants design, we found that none of the three responses were influenced by the wearing of a heavy backpack., En una serie reciente de trabajos, Proffitt y sus colegas informaron de que la distancia a la que se percibe una estimulación diana se ve afectada por el gasto de energía asociado a la realización de cualquier acción, como andar o lanzar un objeto, que pueda realizarse para cubrir la distancia hasta la estimulación diana. Concretamente, Proffitt, Stefanucci, Banton y Epstein (2003) afirmaron que llevar una mochila pesada hizo que se incrementasen los informes verbales sobre la distancia. Realizamos un estudio para verificar si tres respuestas que dependen de la distancia percibida (informe verbal de distancia, andar a ciegas y estimaciones del tamaño de un objeto) son afectadas por el uso de la mochila. En dos experimentos, uno con un diseño inter-participantes y el otro con un diseño intra-participantes, encontramos que ninguna de las tres respuestas era afectada por llevar una mochila pesada.},

  abstract = {A growing empirical literature has demonstrated that perceptions of the physical environment are influenced by the perceiver's behavioral ability. However, prior research has focused only on the perceptual consequences of individual behavior, despite the fact that individuals regularly take part in cooperative social interaction. To test whether similar effects occur as a result of engaging in joint action, we asked participants to estimate anticipated walking distance to a target location when expecting to carry a heavy object either alone or jointly with a confederate. Surprisingly, even though carrying with another person requires less physical effort, on certain carrying tasks participants estimated distances to be farther when expecting help. However, this effect was reversed when participants were asked to focus on the difficulty of the task or told about the alternative experimental condition, thereby making salient for joint carriers the potential, presumably negative, counterfactual of having to work alone. Findings are explained in terms of an ecological approach, which conceptualizes perception as the detection of information specifying affordances. These results highlight the limitations of purely effortful accounts of such phenomena and demonstrate the unique way in which social factors relevant to coordination can alter how people relate to their physical environments.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we show that energetic costs of planned hand movements affect the perception of distances in reaching space. In three experiments, participants prepared hand movements that varied regarding movement amplitude or necessary movement force in either a blockwise or trial-by-trial manner. Before actual execution of the action, a visually presented distance had to be estimated. The results show that judgments of visual distances vary as a function of planned movement amplitude and movement force, specifically, when these parameters change rapidly from moment to moment. These findings show that previous reports of influences of action on perception from extrapersonal space and more enduring changes of action potential generalize to grasping space and much more subtle changes of movement effort. How actions affect visual perception might be determined by the changing parameters of current action plans.},
